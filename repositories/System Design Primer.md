System Design Primer
GitHub stars: 115,000

This is a great repository for software engineers that will help you learn how to design large-scale systems. That will then help you become a better engineer. The repo provides an organized collection of resources for this broad topic.
Because system design often is a required component of the technical interview process at many companies, this repository can also help you to prepare for those interviews with a study guide, advice on how to approach an interview, interview questions with solutions, Anki flashcard sets for interactive learning, and interactive coding challenges.
