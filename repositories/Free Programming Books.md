Free Programming Books
GitHub stars: 168,000

Even though the name of this repository is Free Programming Books, it offers much more than that. It is available in many different languages and contains sections for free online courses, interactive programming resources, problem sets and competitive programming, and podcasts and programming playgrounds.

But the majority deals with programming books. And that really is an awesome collection.
