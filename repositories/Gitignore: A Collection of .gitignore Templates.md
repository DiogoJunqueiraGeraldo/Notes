Gitignore: A Collection of .gitignore Templates
GitHub stars: 111,000

This repository is exactly what the name suggests: a collection of useful .gitignore templates. For every new project you set up as a GitHub repository, it becomes mandatory to have a .gitignore file to filter what gets uploaded. The content of this file varies from project to project and language to language. The repo contains templates for almost any language or framework such as Rails, Python, Perl, Laravel, Java and many more. There even is a template for Fortran!
